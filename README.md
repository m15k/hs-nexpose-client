# Nexpose-Client #

----------
This package provides Haskell bindings for the Rapid7 Nexpose Vulnerability Management solution.  Rapid7 provides an API functionality through Web XML interface pages.  This library aims to be fully api versions 1.1 and 1.2 compliant.  This binding will likely be of limited use for a Haskeller who uses Nexpose, but eh you might be out there.

As with the [Ruby-bindings](https://github.com/rapid7/nexpose-client), please check with Rapid7 [forums](https://community.rapid7.com/community/nexpose "Rapid7 Forums") for Nexpose.
